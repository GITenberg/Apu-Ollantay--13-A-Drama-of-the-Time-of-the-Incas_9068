    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The drama was cultivated by the Incas, and dramatic performances were
      enacted before them. Garcilasso de la Vega, Molina, and Salcamayhua are
      the authorities who received and have recorded the information given by
      the Amautas respecting the Inca drama. Some of these dramas, and portions
      of others, were preserved in the memories of members of Inca and Amauta
      families. The Spanish priests, especially the Jesuits of Juli, soon
      discovered the dramatic aptitude of the people. Plays were composed and
      acted, under priestly auspices, which contained songs and other fragments
      of the ancient Inca drama. These plays were called 'Autos Sacramentales.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But complete Inca dramas were also preserved in the memories of members of
      the Amauta caste and, until the rebellion of 1781, they were acted. The
      drama of Ollantay was first reduced to writing and arranged for acting by
      Dr. Don Antonio Valdez, the Cura of Tinto. It was acted before his friend
      Jose Gabriel Condorcanqui<a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1"
      id="linknoteref-1">[1]</a> in about 1775. Taking the name of his maternal
      ancestor, the Inca Tupac Amaru, the ill-fated Condorcanqui rose in
      rebellion, was defeated, taken, and put to death under torture, in the
      great square of Cuzco. In the monstrous sentence 'the representation of
      dramas as well as all other festivals which the Indians celebrate in
      memory of their Incas' was prohibited.<a href="#linknote-2"
      name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2">[2]</a> This is a clear proof that
      before 1781 these Quichua dramas were acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original manuscript of Valdez was copied by his friend Don Justo
      Pastor Justiniani, and this copy was inherited by his son. There was
      another copy in the convent of San Domingo at Cuzco, but it is corrupt,
      and there are several omissions and mistakes of a copyist. Dr. Valdez
      died, at a very advanced age, in 1816. In 1853 the original manuscript was
      in the possession of his nephew and heir, Don Narciso Cuentas of Tinta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justiniani copy was, in 1853, in the possession of Dr. Don Pablo
      Justiniani, Cura of Laris, and son of Don Justo Pastor Justiniani. He is a
      descendant of the Incas.<a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"
      id="linknoteref-3">[3]</a> In April 1853 I went to Laris, a secluded
      valley of the Andes, and made a careful copy of the drama of Ollantay.
      From this Justiniani text my first very faulty line-for-line translation
      was made in 1871, as well as the present free translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first printed notice of Ollantay appeared in the Museo Erudito, Nos. 5
      to 9, published at Cuzco in 1837, and edited by Don Jose Palacios. The
      next account of the drama, with extracts, was in the 'Antiguedades
      Peruanas,' a work published in 1851 jointly by Dr. von Tschudi and Don
      Mariaiao Rivero of Arequipa. The complete text, from the copy in the
      convent of San Domingo at Cuzco, was first published at Vienna in 1853 by
      Dr. von Tschudi in his 'Die Kechua Sprache. It was obtained for him by Dr.
      Ruggendas of Munich. The manuscript was a corrupt version, and in very bad
      condition, in parts illegible from damp. In 1868 Don Jose Barranca
      published a Spanish translation, from the Dominican text of von Tschudi.
      The learned Swiss naturalist, von Tschudi, published a revised edition of
      his translation at Vienna in 1875, with a parallel German translation. In
      1871 I printed the Justiniani text with a literal, line-for-line
      translation, but with many mistakes, since corrected; and in 1874, a
      Peruvian, Don Jose Fernandez Nodal, published the Quichua text with a
      Spanish translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1878 Gavino Pacheco Zegarra published his version of Ollantay, with a
      free translation in French. His text is a manuscript of the drama which he
      found in his uncle's library. Zegarra, as a native of Peru whose language
      was Quichua, had great advantages. He was a very severe, and often unfair,
      critic of his predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of Zegarra is, however, exceedingly valuable. He was not only a
      Quichua scholar, but also accomplished and well read. His notes on special
      words and on the construction of sentences are often very interesting. But
      his conclusions respecting several passages which are in the Justiniani
      text, but not in the others, are certainly erroneous. Thus he entirely
      spoils the dialogue between the Uillac Uma and Piqui Chaqui by omitting
      the humorous part contained in the Justiniani text; and makes other
      similar omissions merely because the passages are not in his text. Zegarra
      gives a useful vocabulary at the end of all the words which occur in the
      drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great drawback to the study of Zegarra's work is that he invented a
      number of letters to express the various modifications of sound as they
      appealed to his ear. No one else can use them, while they render the
      reading of his own works difficult and intolerably tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last publication of a text of Ollantay was by the Rev. J. H. Gybbon
      Spilsbury, at Buenos Ayres in 1907, accompanied by Spanish, English, and
      French translations in parallel columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is truth in what Zegarra says, that the attempts to translate line
      for line, by von Tschudi and myself, 'fail to convey a proper idea of the
      original drama to European readers, the result being alike contrary to the
      genius of the modern languages of Europe and to that of the Quichua
      language.' Zegarra accordingly gives a very free translation in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present translation I believe that I have always preserved the
      sense of the original, without necessarily binding myself to the words.
      The original is in octosyllabic lines. Songs and important speeches are in
      quatrains of octosyllabic lines, the first and last rhyming, and the
      second and third. I have endeavoured to keep to octosyllabic lines as far
      as possible, because they give a better idea of the original; and I have
      also tried to preserve the form of the songs and speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drama opens towards the close of the reign of the Inca Pachacuti, the
      greatest of all the Incas, and the scene is laid at Cuzco or at
      Ollantay-tampu, in the valley of the Vilcamayu. The story turns on the
      love of a great chief, but not of the blood-royal, with a daughter of the
      Inca. This would not have been prohibited in former reigns, for the
      marriage of a sister by the sovereign or his heir, and the marriage of
      princesses only with princes of the blood-royal, were rules first
      introduced by Pachacuti.<a href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4"
      id="linknoteref-4">[4]</a> His imperial power and greatness led him to
      endeavour to raise the royal family far above all others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play opens with a dialogue between Ollantay and Piqui Chaqui, his
      page, a witty and humorous lad. Ollantay talks of his love for the
      Princess Cusi Coyllur, and wants Piqui Chaqui to take a message to her,
      while the page dwells on the danger of loving in such a quarter, and
      evades the question of taking a message. Then to them enters the Uillac
      Uma, or High Priest of the Sun, who remonstrates with Ollantay&mdash;a
      scene of great solemnity, and very effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next scene is in the Queen's palace. Anahuarqui, the Queen, is
      discovered with the Princess Cusi Coyllur, who bitterly laments the
      absence of Ollantay. To them enters the Inca Pachacuti, quite ignorant
      that his daughter has not only married Ollantay in secret, but that she is
      actually with child by him. Her mother keeps her secret. The Inca indulges
      in extravagant expressions of love for his daughter. Then boys and girls
      enter dancing and singing a harvest song. Another very melancholy yarahui
      is sung; both capable of being turned by the Princess into presages of the
      fate of herself and her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third scene Ollantay prefers his suit to the Inca Pachacuti in
      octosyllabic quatrains, the first and last lines rhyming, and the second
      and third. His suit is rejected with scorn and contempt. Ollantay next
      appears on the heights above Cuzco. In a soliloquy he declares himself the
      implacable enemy of Cuzco and the Inca. Then Piqui Chaqui arrives with the
      news that the Queen's palace is empty, and abandoned, and that Cusi
      Coyllur has quite disappeared; while search is being made for Ollantay.
      While they are together a song is sung behind some rocks, in praise of
      Cusi Coyllur's beauty. Then the sound of clarions and people approaching
      is heard, and Ollantay and Piqui Chaqui take to flight. The next scene
      finds the Inca enraged at the escape of Ollantay, and ordering his general
      Rumi-naui to march at once, and make him prisoner. To them enters a
      chasqui, or messenger, bringing the news that Ollantay has collected a
      great army at Ollantay-tampu, and that the rebels have proclaimed him
      Inca.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second act opens with a grand scene in the hall of the fortress-palace
      of Ollantay-tampu. Ollantay is proclaimed Inca by the people, and he
      appoints the Mountain Chief, Urco Huaranca, general of his army. Urco
      Huaranca explains the dispositions he has made to oppose the army
      advancing from Cuzco, and his plan of defence. In the next scene
      Rumi-naui, as a fugitive in the mountains, describes his defeat and the
      complete success of the strategy of Ollantay and Urco Huaranca. His
      soliloquy is in the octosyllabic quatrains. The last scene of the second
      act is in the gardens of the Convent of Virgins of the Sun. A young girl
      is standing by a gate which opens on the street. This, as afterwards
      appears, is Yma Sumac, the daughter of Ollantay and Cusi Coyllur, aged
      ten, but ignorant of her parentage. To her enters Pitu Salla, an
      attendant, who chides her for being so fond of looking out at the gate.
      The conversation which follows shows that Yma Sumac detests the convent
      and refuses to take the vows. She also has heard the moans of some
      sufferer, and importunes Pitu Salla to tell her who it is. Yma Sumac goes
      as Mama Ccacca enters and cross examines Pitu Salla on her progress in
      persuading Yma Sumac to adopt convent life. This Mama Ccacca is one of the
      Matrons or Mama Cuna, and she is also the jailer of Cusi Coyllur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third act opens with an amusing scene between the Uillac Uma and Piqui
      Chaqui, who meet in a street in Cuzco. Piqui Chaqui wants to get news, but
      to tell nothing, and in this he succeeds. The death of Inca Pachacuti is
      announced to him, and the accession of Tupac Yupanqui, and with this news
      he departs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next there is an interview between the new Inca Tupac Yupanqui, the Uillac
      Uma, and the defeated general Rumi-naui, who promises to retrieve the
      former disaster and bring the rebels to Cuzco, dead or alive. It after
      wards appears that the scheme of Rumi-naui was one of treachery. He
      intended to conceal his troops in eaves and gorges near Ollantay-tampu
      ready to rush in, when a signal was made. Rumi-naui then cut and slashed
      his face, covered himself with mud, and appeared at the gates of
      Ollantay-tampu, declaring that he had received this treatment from the new
      Inca, and imploring protection.<a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5"
      id="linknoteref-5">[5]</a> Ollantay received him with the greatest
      kindness and hospitality. In a few days Ollantay and his people celebrated
      the Raymi or great festival of the sun with much rejoicing and drinking.
      Rumi-naui pretended to join in the festivities, but when most of them were
      wrapped in drunken sleep, he opened the gates, let in his own men, and
      made them all prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is next another scene in the garden of the convent, in which Yma
      Sumac importunes Pitu Salla to tell her the secret of the prisoner. Pitu
      Salla at last yields and opens a stone door. Cusi Coyllur is discovered,
      fastened to a wall, and in a dying state. She had been imprisoned, by
      order of her father, Inca Pachacuti on the birth of Yma Sumac. She is
      restored with food and water, and the relationship is discovered when Cusi
      Coyllur hears the child's name, for she had given it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the Inca Tupac Yupanqui is discovered in the great hall of his
      palace, seated on his tiana or throne, with the Uillac Uma in attendance.
      To them enters a chasqui, or messenger, who describes the result of
      Rumi-naui's treachery in octosyllabic quatrains. Rumi-naui himself enters
      and receives the thanks of his sovereign. Then the prisoners are brought
      in guarded-Ollantay, Hanco Huayllu, Urco Huaranca, and Piqui Chaqui. The
      Inca upbraids them for their treason. He then asks the Uillac Uma for his
      judgment. The High Priest recommends mercy. Rumi-naui advises immediate
      execution: The Inca seems to concur and they are ordered off, when
      suddenly the Inca cries 'Stop.' He causes them all to be released,
      appoints Ollantay to the highest post in the empire next to himself, and
      Urco Huaranca to a high command. There are rejoicings, and in the midst of
      it all Yma Sumac forces her way into the hall, and throws herself at the
      Inca's feet, entreating him to save her mother from death. The Inca hands
      over the matter to Ollantay, but this Yma Sumac will not have, and, the
      Uillac Uma intervening, the Inca consents to go with the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final scene is in the gardens of the convent. The Inca enters with Yma
      Sumac, followed by the whole strength of the company. Mama Ccacca is
      ordered to open the stone door and Cusi Coyllur is brought out. She proves
      to be the sister of the Inca and the wife of Ollantay. There are
      explanations, and all ends happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the antiquity of the drama of Ollantay there is now no question.
      General Mitre wrote an elaborate paper on its authenticity, raising
      several points to prove that it was of modern origin. But every point he
      raised has been satisfactorily refuted. At the same time there are many
      other points, some of them referred to by Zegarra, which establish the
      antiquity of the drama beyond any doubt. The antiquity of the name
      Ollantay-tampu, applied to the fortress in memory of the drama, is proved
      by its use in the narratives of Molina (1560) and of Salcamayhua.
    </p>
    <p>
      An able review of the literature connected with the drama of Ollantay was
      written by Don E. Larrabure y Unanue, the present Vice-President of Peru,
      who considers that Ollantay would make a good acting play with magnificent
      scenic effects.

    </p>
    <p>
      There is light thrown upon the name Ollantay by the evidence taken during
      the journey of the Viceroy Toledo from Jauja to Cuzco, from November 1570
      to March 1571. He wanted information respecting the origin of the Inca
      government, and 200 witnesses were examined, the parentage or lineage of
      each witness being recorded. Among these we find six witnesses of the
      Antasayac ayllu. Sayac means a station or division, Anta is a small town
      near Cuzco. The names of the six Anta witnesses were,
    </p>
    <p>
      ANCAILLO; USCA; HUACRO; MANCOY; AUCA PURI; ULLANTAY;
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides ANTONIO PACROTRICA and PUNICU PAUCAR, Chiefs of Anta.
    </p>
    <p>
      We thus find that the name of Ollantay belonged to Anta. Now the Incas
      were under great obligations to the chief of Anta, for that chief had
      rescued the eldest son of Inca Rocca from the chief of Ayamarca, and had
      restored him to his father. For this great service the chief of Anta was
      declared to be a noble of the highest rank and cousin to the Inca family.
      Moreover, the daughter of the Anta chief was married to the Inca
      Uira-cocha, and was the mother of Pachacuti. Assuming, as seems probable,
      that Ollantay was a son of the chief of Anta, he would be a cousin of the
      Inca, and of very high rank, though not an agnate of the reigning family.
      This, I take it, is what is intended. Pachacuti desired to raise his
      family high above all others, and that, consequently, there should be no
      marriages with subjects even of the highest rank; and his excessive
      severity on the transgression of his rule by his daughter is thus
      explained.

      An open space near the junction of the two torrents of Cuzco, the Huatanay
      and Tullumayu or Rodadero, called Pumap Chupan, just outside the gardens
      of the Sun. The Temple of the Sun beyond the gardens, and the Sacsahuaman
      hill surmounted by the fortress, rising in the distance. The palace of
      Colcampata on the hillside.

    <p>
      (Enter OLLANTAY L. [in a gilded tunic, breeches of llama sinews, usutas or
      shoes of llama hide, a red mantle of ccompi or fine cloth, and the chucu
      or head-dress of his rank, holding a battle-axe (champi) and club
      (macana)] and PIQUI CHAQUI coming up from the back R. [in a coarse brown
      tunic of auasca or llama cloth, girdle used as a sling, and chucu or
      head-dress of a Cuzqueno].)

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  Where, young fleet-foot, hast thou been?
  Hast thou the starry nusta seen?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  The Sun forbids such sacrilege
  'Tis not for me to see the star.
  Dost thou, my master, fear no ill,
  Thine eyes upon the Inca's child?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  In spite of all I swear to love
  That tender dove, that lovely star;
  My heart is as a lamb<a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6"
      id="linknoteref-6">[6]</a> with her,
  And ever will her presence seek.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  Such thoughts are prompted by Supay<a href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7"
      id="linknoteref-7">[7]</a>;
  That evil being possesses thee.
  All round are beauteous girls to choose
  Before old age, and weakness come.
  If the great Inca knew thy plot
  And what thou seekest to attain,
  Thy head would fall by his command,
  Thy body would be quickly burnt.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  Boy, do not dare to cross me thus.
  One more such word and thou shalt die.
  These hands will tear thee limb from limb,
  If still thy councils are so base.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  Well! treat thy servant as a dog,
  But do not night and day repeat,
  'Piqui Chaqui! swift of foot!
  Go once more to seek the star.'
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  Have I not already said
  That e'en if death's fell scythe<a href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8"
      id="linknoteref-8">[8]</a> was here,
  If mountains should oppose my path
  Like two fierce foes<a href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9"
      id="linknoteref-9">[9]</a> who block the way,
  Yet will I fight all these combined
  And risk all else to gain my end,
  And whether it be life or death
  I'll cast myself at Coyllur's feet.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  But if Supay himself should come?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  I'd strike the evil spirit down.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  If thou shouldst only see his nose,
  Thou wouldst not speak as thou dost now.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  Now, Piqui Chaqui, speak the truth,
  Seek not evasion or deceit.
  Dost thou not already know,
  Of all the flowers in the field,
  Not one can equal my Princess?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  Still, my master, thou dost rave.
  I think I never saw thy love.
  Stay! was it her who yesterday
  Came forth with slow and faltering steps
  And sought a solitary<a href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10"

      name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11">[11]</a>?
  If so, 'tis true she's like the sun,
  The moon less beauteous than her face.<a href="#linknote-12"

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

  It surely was my dearest love.
  How beautiful, how bright is she
  This very moment thou must go
  And take my message to the Star.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  I dare not, master; in the day,
  I fear to pass the palace gate.
  With all the splendour of the court,
  I could not tell her from the rest.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  Didst thou not say thou sawest her?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  I said so, but it was not sense.
  A star can only shine at night
  Only at night could I be sure.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ollantay.

  Begone, thou lazy good-for-nought.
  The joyful star that I adore,
  If placed in presence of the Sun,
  Would shine as brightly as before.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Piqui Chaqui.

  Lo! some person hither comes,
  Perhaps an old crone seeking alms;
  Yes! Look! he quite resembles one.
  Lot him the dangerous message take.
  Send it by him, O noble Chief!
  From me they would not hear the tale;
  Thy page is but a humble lad.

  O giver of all warmth and light
  O Sun! I fall and worship thee.

  Old man! thine aspect causes fear,
  Thy presence here some ill forebodes;
  All round thee dead men's bones appear,
  Baskets, flowers, sacrifice.
  All men when they see thy face
  Are filled with terror and alarm.
  What means it all? why comest thou?
  It wants some months before the least.
  Is it that the Inca is ill?
  Perchance hast thou some thought divined
  Which soon will turn to flowing blood.
  Why comest thou? the Sun's great day,
  The Moon's libations are not yet
  The moon has not yet nearly reached
  The solemn time for sacrifice.
  Uillac Uma. Why dost thou these questions put,
  In tones of anger and reproach?
  Am I, forsooth, thy humble slave?
  That I know all I'll quickly prove.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

  My beating heart is filled with dread,
  Beholding thee so suddenly;
  Perchance thy coming is a sign,
  Of evils overtaking me.

  Fear not, Ollantay! not for that,
  The High Priest comes to thee this day.
  It is perhaps for love of thee,
  That, as a straw is blown by wind,
  A friend, this day, encounters thee.
  Speak to me as to a friend,
  Hide nothing from my scrutiny.
  This day I come to offer thee
  A last and most momentous choice
  'Tis nothing less than life or death.

  'Tis well. Now listen, warlike. Chief
  My science has enabled me,
  To learn and see all hidden things
  Unknown to other mortal men.
  My power will enable me
  To make of thee a greater prince.
  I brought thee up from tender years,
  And cherished thee with love and care
  I now would guide thee in the right,
  And ward off all that threatens thee.
  As chief of Anti-suyu now,
  The people venerate thy name;
  Thy Sovereign trusts and honours thee,
  E'en to sharing half his realm.
  From all the rest he chose thee out,
  And placed all power in thy hands;
  He made thy armies great and strong,
  And strengthened thee against thy foes
  How numerous soe'er they be,
  They have been hunted down by thee.
  Are these good reasons for thy wish,
  To wound thy Sovereign to the heart?
  His daughter is beloved by thee;
  Thy passion thou wouldst fain indulge,
  Lawless and forbidden though it be.
  I call upon thee, stop in time,
  Tear this folly from thy heart.
  If thy passion is immense,
  Still let honour hold its place.
  You reel, you stagger on the brink
  I'd snatch thee from the very edge.
  Thou knowest well it cannot be,
  The Inca never would consent.
  If thou didst e'en propose it now,
  He would be overcome with rage;
  From favoured prince and trusted chief,
  Thou wouldst descend to lowest rank.
</pre>

  What still is hidden in my heart?
  Her mother only knows my love,
  Yet thou revealest all to me.

  I read thy secret on the moon,
  As if upon the Quipu knots;
  And what thou wouldst most surely hide,
  Is plain to me as all the rest.

  'Tis ready to twist round my throat
  Yet its threads are woven with gold,
  It avenges a brilliant crime.
  Cusi Coyllur e'en now is my wife,
  Already we 're bound and are one;
  My blood now runs in her veins,
  E'en now I am noble as she.
  Her mother has knowledge of all,
  The Queen can attest what I say;
  Let me tell all this to the King,
  I pray for thy help and advice.
  I will speak without fear and with force,
  He may perhaps give way to his rage
  Yet he may consider my youth,
  May remember the battles I've fought;
  The record is carved on my club.

      gardens with the snowy peak of Vilcanota in the distance. Walls covered
      with golden slabs. On either side of the doorway three recesses, with
      household gods in the shape of maize-cobs and llamas, and gold vases in

  Since when hast thou lost all thy joy,
  Thy smile and thy once merry laugh?
  Tears of grief now pour down my face,
  As I watch and mourn over my child;
  Thy grief makes me ready to die.

  How can my tears o'er cease to flow,
  How can my bitter sighs surcease,
  While the valiant Chief I worship
  For many days and sleepless nights,
  All heedless of my tender years,
  Seems quite to have forgotten me?
  He has turned his regard from his wife
  And no longer seeks for his love.
  O my mother! O most gracious Queen!
  O my husband so beloved!
  Since the day when I last saw my love
  The moon has been hidden from view;
  The sun shines no more as of old,
  In rising it rolls among mist;
  At night the stars are all dim,
  All nature seems sad and distressed
  The comet with fiery tail,
  Announces my sorrow and grief
  Surrounded by darkness and tears,
  Evil auguries fill me with fears.

  O Sovereign Inca, great and brave,
  Rewards I know were also mine,

  To me they ever yield with grace,
  And thine, great King, is all their land
  My deeds, my merits are thine own

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In a moment I lost my beloved,
  She was gone, and I never knew where;
  I sought her in fields and in woods,
  Asking all if they 'd seen the Coyllur.
  Her face was so lovely and fair,
  They called her the beautiful Star.
  No one else can be taken for her,
  With her beauty no girl can compare.
  Both the sun and the moon seem to shine,
  Resplendent they shine from a height,
  Their rays to her beauty resign
  Their brilliant light with delight.
  Her hair is a soft raven black,
  Her tresses are bound with gold thread,
  They fall in long folds down her back,
  And add charm to her beautiful head.
  Her eyelashes brighten her face,
  Two rainbows less brilliant and fair,
  Her eyes full of mercy and grace,
  With nought but two, suns can compare.
  The eyelids with arrows concealed,
  Gaily shoot their rays into the heart
  They open, lo! beauty revealed,
  Pierces through like a glittering dart.
  Her cheeks Achancara<a href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35"
      id="linknoteref-35">[35]</a> on snow,
  Her face more fair than the dawn,
  From her mouth the laughter doth flow,
  Between pearls as bright as the morn.
  Smooth as crystal and spotlessly clear
  Is her throat, like the corn in a sheaf
  Her bosoms, which scarcely appear,
  Like flowers concealed by a leaf.
  Her beautiful hand is a sight,
  As it rests from all dangers secure,
  Her fingers transparently white,
  Like icicles spotless and pure.

  Ollantay, thou hast been proclaimed
  By all the Antis as their Lord.
  The women weep, as you will see&mdash;
  They lose their husbands and their sons,
  Ordered to the Chayanta war.
  When will there be a final stop
  To distant wars? Year after year
  They send us all to far-off lands,
  Where blood is made to flow like rain.
  The King himself is well supplied
  With coca and all kinds of food.
  What cares he that his people starve?
  Crossing the wilds our llamas die,
  Our feet are wounded by the thorns,
  And if we would not die of thirst
  We carry water on our backs.

  Gallant friends! Ye hear those words,
  Ye listen to the mountain chief.
  Filled with compassion for my men,
  I thus, with sore and heavy heart,
  Have spoken to the cruel king:
  'The Anti-suyu must have rest;
  All her best men shan't die for thee,
  By battle, fire, and disease&mdash;
  They die in numbers terrible.
  How many men have ne'er returned,
  How many chiefs have met their death
  For enterprises far away?'
  For this I left the Inca's court,<a href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37"
      id="linknoteref-37">[37]</a>
  Saying that we must rest in peace;
  Lot none of us forsake our hearths,
  And if the Inca still persists,
  Proclaim with him a mortal feud.

  Thou art a fated rolling stone,<a href="#linknote-51" name="linknoteref-51"
      id="linknoteref-51">[51]</a>
  Escaped indeed, but quite alone,
  And this is now thy yarahui.
  Ollantay posted on the height,
  Thou couldst not either fight or see,
  Thy men did quickly fall or flee;
  No room was there to move or fight.
  Thou knowest now thy heart did beat
  And flutter like a butterfly;
  Thy skill thou couldst not then apply,
  No course was left thee but retreat.
  They had recourse to a surprise,
  Our warriors immolated quite.
  Ah! that alone could turn thee white&mdash;
  From shame like that, canst e'er arise?
  By thousands did thy warriors fall,
  I hardly could alone escape,
  With open mouth fell death did gape,
  A great disaster did befall.
  Holding that traitor to be brave,
  I sought to meet him face to face&mdash;
  Rushing to seek him with my mace,
  I nearly found a warrior's grave.
  My army then was near the hill,
  When suddenly the massive stones
  Came crashing down, with cries and moans,
  While clarions sounded loud and shrill.
  A rain of stones both great and small
  Down on the crowd of warriors crashed,
  On every side destruction flashed,
  Thy heart the slaughter did appal.
  Like a strong flood the blood did flow,
  Inundating the ravine;
  So sad a sight thou ne'er hast seen&mdash;
  No man survived to strike a blow.
  O thou who art by this disgraced,
  What figure canst thou ever show
  Before the king, who seeks to know
  The truth, which must be faced?
  'Tis better far myself to kill,
  Or losing every scrap of hope,
  To hang my body with this rope.

      A garden in the house of the Virgins of the Sun. Chilca shrubs and mulli

  Yma Sumac, do not approach

  Will surely pass from mouth to mouth.
  Honour shall be shown to chosen ones,<a href="#linknote-53"

  Amuse thyself within the walls,
  And no one then can say a word.
  Think well what you can find within&mdash;
  It gives you all you can desire,
  Of dresses, gold, and dainty food.
  Thou art beloved by every one,
  E'en Virgins of the royal blood.
  The Mothers love to carry thee,
  They give thee kisses and caress&mdash;
  You they prefer to all the rest.
  What more could any one desire,
  Than always to remain with them,
  Destined to be servant of the Sun?
  In contemplating Him there's peace.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Yma Sumac.

  Pitu Salla, ever you repeat
  The same thing and the same advice;
  I will open to thee my whole heart,
  And say exactly what I think.
  Know that to me this court and house
  Are insupportable&mdash;no less;
  The place oppresses&mdash;frightens me&mdash;
  Each day I curse my destiny.
  The faces of all the Mama Cuna
  Fill me with hatred and disgust,
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And from the place they make me sit,
  Nothing else is visible.
  Around me there is nothing bright,
  All are weeping and ne'er cease
  If I could ever have my way,
  No person should remain within.
  I see the people pass outside,
  Laughing as they walk along.
  The reason it is plain to see&mdash;
  They are not mewed and cloistered here.
  Is it because I have no mother,
  That I am kept a prisoner?
  Or is it I 'm a rich novice?
  Then from to-day I would be poor.
  Last night I could not get to sleep,
  I wandered down a garden walk;
  In the dead silence of the night,
  I heard one mourn.  A bitter cry,
  As one who sought and prayed for death.
  On every side I looked about,
  My hair almost on end with fright,
  Trembling, I cried, 'Who canst thou be?'
  Then the voice murmured these sad words:
  'O Sun, release me from this place!'
  And this, amidst such sighs and groans!
  I searched about, but nothing found&mdash;
  The grass was rustling in the wind.
  I joined my tears to that sad sound,
  My heart was torn with trembling fear.
  When now the recollection comes,
  I'm filled with sorrow and with dread.
  You know now why I hate this place.
  Speak no more, my dearest friend,
  Of reasons for remaining here.

  The King know not that we were joined

  And when he came to ask my hand,
  That King dismissed him in a rage,
  And cruelly confined me here.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
